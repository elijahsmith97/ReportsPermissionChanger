"# ReportsPermissionChanger" 
Problem:
Before this application, users on the AES system were able to view any report they wanted to pull from the database at any time. This means that reports that might be considered sensitive were not secure in a way that "for your eyes only" wasn't applicable.

Solution:
This program is meant to handle the authorization of what Users on the network can view certain reports within the AES system. My application assures that departments can view their department's reports and their reports only.
